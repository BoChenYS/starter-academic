I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), the University of Adelaide. My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and computer vision. Specific topics include: object detection, object pose estimation, differentiable geometric optimisation, domain adaptation, and adversarial learning.
