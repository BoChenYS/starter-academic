abstract: "The SpotGEO dataset is the official dataset of ESA's Kelvins competition for 'spotting GEO satellites'. It consists of 6400 grayscale image sequences of the night sky. These sequences were acquired from multiple positions using a low-cost ground based telescope. Each sequence consists of 5 frames, so in total this dataset consists of 32000 grayscale PNG images. The dataset is split to 'train' and 'test' subsets. Version 2.0.0: This version provides the annotations for the test set which were used to evaluate the final score in the competition. Additionally, a small set of missing annotations that were discovered during the competition for the train part have been added."
